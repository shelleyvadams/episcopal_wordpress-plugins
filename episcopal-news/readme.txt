Headlines from Episcopal News Service and featured videos from The Episcopal Church, Office of Communication.


== Description ==

Plugin features:

* Shortcode to display Episcopal News Service headlines (Widget coming soon).
* Shortcode to embed The Episcopal Church, Office of Communication featured videos playlist.

This plugin was initially derived from content that was hard-coded into a
front page template of themes developed for The Episcopal Church and offered as
a free website resource for dioceses and congregations.


== Installation ==

After activating the plugin, you can add headlines to your WordPress site using
the shortcode `[episcopalnews]`. In future releases, this shortcode will support
parameters to control the number of headlines as well as the display of item
summaries and thumbnail images.

The featured videos playlist can be embedded with the shortcode
`[episcopalvideo]`. Currently, there are no plans to add parameters to this
shortcode.
